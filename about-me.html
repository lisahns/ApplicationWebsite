          Hello! I'm Lisa Hanes (she/her) and I am hoping to pursue a career in tech. 
          I grew up in Germany and have been living in London for nearly four years and consider it my new home. 
          Before coming to London, I went backpacking in the USA and Mexico, where I volunteered for all sorts 
          of different companies and charities. Soon I will be graduating from the University of Westminster with 
          a BA (Hons) in Photography. 
      <br><br>
        I had my first coding experience last year, where I attended an 8-week introduction course hosted 
        by <i>Code First Girls</i>. I really enjoyed learning about programming and being able to solve problems 
        and build projects. This made me commit to becoming a web developer. Over the past few months, I have 
        learned a lot about HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the help of friends, the weekly meetups organised by 
        FaC and the discord channel. <br><br>
        I really enjoy the peer-led learning approach that <i>Founders and Coders</i> practices. Not only is it a great pedagogical method which makes 
        learning so much more enjoyable and fun, but it is also fantastic opportunity to develop a set of other 
        skills, such as working in a team or communication skills, which will be relevant in my future career. 
        I am confident that my skills and enthusiasm will allow me to make the most of my time with <i>FaC</i>. I am 
        looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of the <i>FaC</i> community and work alongside other talented 
        people.
